Store encryption keys securely within the TPM instead of software or filesystem storage.
Use TPM to generate cryptographic keys (e.g., AES keys) securely.


Secure File Encryption Key Storage:
	When a user encrypts a file, the encryption key is generated and stored in the TPM.
	The TPM-protected key is then used for encryption operations, ensuring that the key never leaves the secure environment of the TPM.

File Encryption and Decryption Process:
	Upon attempting to access an encrypted file, the application requests the TPM to unseal the encryption key.
	The TPM verifies the system's state and, if valid, provides the key for decryption.
	The file is then decrypted, and access is granted to the user.


Performance and Usability:
	Assess the impact of TPM-based encryption on system performance.
	Explore user experience considerations and develop strategies to minimize any negative impacts.

Hi Hari, what would be the TPM use cases in our Agent? I can think of following.

Use cases of TPM in agent:
	To generate file keys (AES keys)
	To store private keys associated with client certificates (agent's user-level/service-level client certificates)
	To store Offline Master key
	To store the secret cloud constants

I want to integrate Microsoft's TPM 2.0 TSS C++ library into my application for the following use cases.
1. Use TPM to generate file keys (AES keys)
2. To store private keys associated with client certificates
3. To store Master key
4. To store the secret cloud constants

=>
To integrate Microsoft's TPM 2.0 TSS (Trusted Platform Module) C++ library into your application for the specified use cases, follow these steps:

Set Up Your Development Environment:
	Ensure you have a TPM 2.0 device on your system. If you're using a virtual machine or testing environment, you can use a software TPM like Microsoft's TPM simulator.
	Install the necessary tools and libraries. You might need tpm2-tss and related dependencies. On Windows, you can find the library on GitHub at tpm2-tss.
Include the TSS Library in Your Project:
	Clone the repository and include the library in your project.
	Link against the TSS library in your build configuration.
Initialize the TPM Context:
	Initialize the TPM context and establish a session to communicate with the TPM.
Generating AES Keys:
	Use the TPM to generate AES keys for encrypting files.
	Create a primary key in the storage hierarchy.
	Use the primary key to derive AES keys.
Storing Private Keys for Client Certificates:
	Load your client certificate's private key into the TPM.
	Use TPM key handles to reference these keys securely.
Storing a Master Key:
	Similar to storing private keys, generate or import a master key into the TPM.
	Use this key for various cryptographic operations as needed by your application.
Storing Secret Cloud Constants:
	Use the TPM's NV (Non-Volatile) storage to store sensitive constants.
	This ensures that the constants remain secure and tamper-resistant.

TSS.MSR: The TPM Software Stack from Microsoft Research
In addition to physical TPM devices, the TSS.MSR libraries can also connect to a TPM simulator to enable application development and debugging on platforms that do not have a TPM 2.0 device. Last published: December 18, 2015.

The connection to the simulator is over a TCP/IP socket so the simulator may be running on a remote machine or in another process on the same machine. Below you will find a link to download the TPM2 Simulator binary for use with the TSS.MSR TPM2 libraries.
